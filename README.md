```
It is a static site mimicking a dynamic website thanks to [`angular-cli-ghpages`][angular-cli-ghpages] as part of [`@angular/cli`][angular-cli]. It has been compiled to es6 and contains transpilers, thus it should be fully cross browser compatible on the code side.

First mock-up of site looks like this...

![A side by side comparison of the website in mobile and desktop versions. The desktop version is more design oriented with clip-paths. The desktop is simple and straight-forward][mock-up]

The site is still going to have some of the old comic feel to it, but in a cleaner, more balanced design. The color changes, which are far overdo, are more warm and vibrant to better reflect who I am as a designer and person.

And just because I want to play with MarkDown's blockqoute feature, please enjoy the following quote from Edgar Allen Poe's [_The Raven_][the-raven] :

>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  
Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—  
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—  
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”  
Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
